	<h2>"Not" a Development Blog</h3>
		<p><strong>10/6/2016</strong>: Beta v.1.01 of this site, we added pages for scratch, java, python, etc. None of them are completed, just the links :P </p>
		<p><strong>10/10/2016</strong>: Finished Scratch Page, It contains all of my projects for our scratch unit :P</p>
		<p><strong>10/11/2016</strong>: Added Background picture, I'm still thinking over pirate map or Mars... I have no idea :P</p>
		<p><strong>10/13/2016</strong>: Added a page for Jeroo, whats a Jeroo? I don't know, why did I add the page? I don't know why. Also I'm thinking of adding in music like a sound effect when you visit the website, or maybe just a music page. Or an about me...</p>

		<p>I guess my hobby would be drawing maps. Yes, this programmer writing a website for school is kind of a nerd as you can tell from the pictures of MAHRS and some other stuff. At least I'm good at it due to... way... to... much... practice. Also apparently I'm supposed to include sports here but I'm a nerd... so lets not go there shall we?
