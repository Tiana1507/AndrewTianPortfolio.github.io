		<h1> Why do I Like This Masterpiece? </h1>
		<p> I enjoyed this movie because when I first watched it, I was surprised and brought in by suspense for every action done by Heath Ledger's Joker. I also particularly enjoyed the effects of the movie especially knowing that Nolan did all of them practically. I also liked the amazing plot that kept twisting around with a dark tone that brought comic book movies from cheese fests into the gritty realism they are today.

		<h1> Favorite Actor? </h1>
		<p> Well it certainly depends on the scenario. If it's of all time or just for the movie then I'll have 2 different answers to you. My favorite actor of all time might be Harrison Ford because of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and so many other movies I love. If you are asking what my favorite actor is from The Dark Knight, then probable Heath Ledger, who apparently locked himself in a hotel room for a month to prepare for the role of the joker. That is certainly commitment, and that payed off given how amazing the joker was in this batman movie. </p>
