	<h1> Why do I Like This Masterpiece? </h1>
	<p> I enjoyed this movie because when I first watched it, I was surprised and brought in by suspense for every action done by Heath Ledger's Joker. I also particularly enjoyed the effects of
	the movie especially knowing that Nolan did all of them practically. I also liked the amazing plot that kept twisting around with a dark tone that brought comic book movies from cheese fests into
	the gritty realism they are today.

	<h1> Favorite Actor? </h1>
	<p> Well it certainly depends on the scenario. If it's of all time or just for the movie then I'll have 2 different answers to you. My favorite actor of all time might be Mark Hamil because of star wars and the joker he voiced in Arkham Assylum. If you are asking what my favorite actor is from The Dark Knight, then probable Heath Ledger, who apparently locked himself in a hotel room for a month to prepare for the role of the joker. That is certainly commitment, and that payed off given how amazing the joker was in this batman movie. </p>
