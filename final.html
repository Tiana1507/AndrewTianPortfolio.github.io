	<h1>Final Projects</h1>
		<h1>Scratch Final Project</h1>
		<img src="images/scratchFinal.jpg" width="600" height="450"/>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This was my final project in the scratch curriculum of the year. I was given the option of a game or story, I happen to chose Game. I created a maze-esque game with a car looking around for coins with cops on the prowl for him. Most of the game revolves around the if then function for detecting what level and how many coins have been collected. A green flag and space key are required to start the game.</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
			<li>How to Code sprite detection</li>
			<li>How to make a game over</li>
			<li>Use variables to set conditions per level and detect what level it is</li>
			<li>How to use variables and broadcast to detect end of level</li>
		<h1>Python Final Project</h1>
		<img src="images/PythonFinalProject.png" width="600" height="450"/>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This was my Final Project for Python. What I did was make one of those endless killing spree games. (I know, it sounds horrible, and in retrospect why did I call it that?) You go around as link (All copyright goes to our Nintendo Overlords) and you go around trying to kill enemies. If you touch them without your sword extended... simply put you die. </p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
			<li>Use Lists for having multiple enemies</li>
			<li>How to create an "attack" function</li>
		<h1>Java Final Project</h1>
		<p>This was my final project for Java. What we did was a text based choose your own adventure game, and I had to write almost 300 lines of dialogue along with it. We had to utilize loops and work with parts of Java to make our own little stories</p>
