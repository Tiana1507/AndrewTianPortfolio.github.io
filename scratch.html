	<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Used scratch to create an animation of my name. The requirements were to add in at least an infinite loop, each letter of my name must have a unique personality, and give them 3 unique behaviors. To start the program, you pressed the green flag, I added a function to reset the screen and to start everything over again. It was very much like a cartoon with a bit of humor in it. </p>
	<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<li>I learned how to use broadcast to tell the sprite when to jump and respond with accuracy rather than having to put many wait blocks</li>
		<li>I also learned how to use event blocks (green flag and space bar)</li>
		<li>Learned how to use loops (forever block) to repeat over and over again</li>
		<li>I learned how to use X and Y values to make the movements of the letters more accurate and precise than a move block." </li>
