	Created This Page, this is not a BLOG, I'm serious please don't treat it as such, I still want some respect from my friends alright? What's going to be their reaction when they find this page, will they disown me? No! I can't let that happen must delete page! 
	</p>
	<!--Tries to delete page [NotABlog]-->

	Wait, uh why is it not deleting! NO... this page must exist then... Sigh... Well it's NOT A BLAGGGG I'm gonna repeat this until you acknowledge the truth: This is totally not a blog. Also did any of you see the first presidential debate? It was kinda crazy wasn't it? Well Right now it's Thursday and I would rather think about Friday then... *shudders* Monday. Well either way thank you for visiting my NOT A BLAGGGG page today. Come back daily for updates... Also please give me your netflix, HBO go, Hulu, and Amazon Prime account. Please? Please? Like pretty please?
