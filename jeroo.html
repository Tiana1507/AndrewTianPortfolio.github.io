		<p>10/13/2016: Well we haven't done much with Jeroo, and this is only my second day doing it :P so give me a break? \_("/)_/</p>
		<p>Even though we haven't done much I can tell that Jeroo is more of a Java/C++ based language that you use to solve puzzles. However when I need to make a loop, I can't figure out how to make a variable so for now I guess copy and paste will do...</p>

		<p>You see, thats just a little example of me repeating commands, but I mean sure this is just 2 hops but like what if I have to do 20 hops? I really do need to know how to make variables in Jeroo, I've worked with both Java and C++. Int doesn't seem to be doing the trick. I really don't know maybe I got so used to python I forgot how to use the other 2 languages.</p>
